FilePond is framework agnostic, this means that besides JavaScript support it doesn't have any dependencies.

Because it's framework agnostic it should be possible to use FilePond with any JavaScript framework or library, it doesn't guarantee that this integration is going to be easy though.

That's where wrappere components come into play, wrapper components are tiny components that facilitate the communication between each framework and FilePond, making it easier to use FilePond on your project.
